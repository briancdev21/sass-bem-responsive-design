                <p>Yes. If within 14 days of signing your loan agreement and Lendfair transferring the funds you decide the loan
                  is not for you or you find you donâ€™t need it any longer, then you can cancel the loan agreement. There are
                  no fees or penalties if you cancel. However you will need to repay the loan advance in full together with any
                  interest due before cancellation can take effect.</p>
                <p>You can of course repay the loan, in full at any time during the agreement and Lendfair only charge interest
                  for the time the loan was outstanding. There are no fees or penalties charged for early repayment.</p>
                <p>The right to cancel and the choice to repay, at any time, is a decision for the borrower. Once a guarantor signs
                  the Guarantee and Indemnity Agreement and the funds are transferred a guarantor cannot cancel their agreement
                  or the Loan Agreement. However a guarantor can withdraw at any time prior to this by simply notifying Lendfair
                  they do not wish to proceed.</p>

                Yes. At LendFair we fix the rate of interest for the duration of your loan. This means that whatever happens to market interest
                rates your regular payment amount is fixed for the duration of your loan with us. We think a fixed interest rate
                is fair and transparent and allows you to plan and budget for the same payment each month.

                Yes. This allows you to plan and budget for the same loan repayment each month during the term of the loan. Even if market
                interest rates increase your repayment and term are fixed by contract. However, if you find yourself in changed
                circumstances, hardship or canâ€™t afford the regular repayments, then contact LendFair asap and we may be able
                to reduce your payments to a more affordable sum by extending your loan period rather than asking your Guarantor
                to pay. And remember if you make overpayments, regularly or ad-hoc, or pay off your loan early, then LendFair
                rebate future interest so you will pay less overall. How fair is that! ` </div>

                Most people want a low affordable monthly repayment, and we find 6 months the shortest period to achieve this.
                <strong>BUT</strong> remember you can take a 6 month loan and repay it earlier knowing we will rebate interest charges;
                so in theory you can get a shorter loan and only pay interest for the time borrowed. fair lending!

                Once we have approved your application, and approved your guarantor, we simply transfer the requested loan amount to the
                bank account of your guarantor. The whole process can take up to two days due to certain documentary requirements
                and depending on how quickly you and your guarantor respond
                <strong>but in most cases it is within 24 hours and can sometimes be the same day</strong>. Your guarantor then simply
                transfers the money to you. Getting your guarantor on-board before you start the loan application will speed
                up the transfer of funds.

                This depends on your circumstances and views. Compared to payday loans, pawnbroking and unapproved overdrafts, then yes it
                is likely that a LendFair loan will appear cheap, often a fraction of the interest charged by others on alternative
                unsecured borrowing. But compared to secure lending, then no, LendFair is not cheap, but we still think our rates
                are fair, competitive and certainly one of the cheapest amongst the alternative lenders. If you can get a traditional
                loan at lower interest rates we urge you to go this route.

                  <a href="about-our-loans.php#wiag">Guarantor</a>

                verbal communication. So if you use a translator we can work with them (all calls are recorded) and we can, during
                most stages of the application, provide you &amp;/or your guarantor with written forms &amp;/or communications.
                Obviously email, on-line chat &amp; SMS will not delay any application whereas traditional mail services will

              It has come to our attention that websites pretending to be LendFair appear from time to time on the Internet. They even
              use similar colours and styles as genuine websites to make you think they are the real deal.
              <strong>Beware!</strong> They are scams out to get your money or bank details! At LendFair we never ask for money up front;
              <strong>EVER!</strong> Nor do our real partners and comparison sites, who will simply link you to our 100% genuine website
              <strong>www.lendfair.co.uk</strong>. We only operate in the UK and only offer loans to UK residents with a UK bank account.
              Stay safe and only deal with
              <strong>www.lendfair.co.uk</strong> any variation on the name LendFair is
              <strong>NOT</strong> us and not genuine. Also beware of any emails pretending to be us - all our emails will come from
              @lendfair.co.uk we never use any variation around that or any email services such as Google mail, Yahoo mail etc.
              If in doubt call us on 03333 237 637 or 01279 636 260. Do not pay any monies and do not give out your bank details.

                LendFair are always looking for good partners and agents promoting our loan products via the web and social media. At itâ€™s
                easiest, a simple banner on your site linking it to LendFair can earn you money; and for those actively generating
                pre-qualified leads, or links, to our web applications you are likely to earn far more. For simple links we ask
                you to complete an approved supplier questionnaire and restrict any promotion to approved images and text. We
                can provide finished banner and text examples to get you going, or if you want to wrapper existing promotions
                in the Lendfair style we provide marketing guidelines and images. For those publishing more detailed financial
                promotions or operating specifically in the Financial Services sector we also ask that you are authorised by
                the FCA. Reward is based on a fee paid to you based on the loan advance; we provide tracking and full analysis
                of all unique traffic and advances monthly for billing purposes. Want to know more? Contact; colinb@lendfair.co.uk
